    heading: "Mission Statement:"
    text: "We have witnessed a degradation of our morals, core values, human rights, our judicial system, honesty, global respect, respect for our Constitution and Bill of Rights, fairness, protection from foreign governments, relationship with our Allies, and office of Presidency because of our 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. He has failed all of us. We must tell him and the whole world that HE HAS FAILED!"

    text: "HeFails.com is the ultimate hub to keep the public posted on the ongoing trainwreck that is Donald J. Trump and his presidency. HeFails.com hopes you will join us and grow the #HeFails movement with the proliferation of our unique, well-constructed, and affordable ’He Fails’ rally/protest signs and printed graphic t-shirts. Let’s band together and stand against this existential crisis that our nation is facing.
